                <h1>Candidate Chapter History</h1>
                <p>
                  In spring of 2018, Mark Muendelein met a handful of brothers
                  from the Epsilon Delta chapter of Theta Tau chartered at UC
                  San Diego. Muendelein had realized that his community and his
                  career were destined for two different directions. In an
                  attempt to bridge this gap, Mundelein decided to enlist
                  friends, peers, colleagues, and mentors to being a chapter of
                  Theta Tau at San Jose State University. At the end of the
                  summer, after having spoken slew of connections, Muendelein
                  held the first general meeting of what would later become the
                  organization Silicon Valley Engineers of San Jose State
                  University.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first couple meetings were set to establish publicity
                  plans and member selection criteria, as well as establish
                  leadership roles within the organization. As the fall semester
                  progressed, word about this interest group for Theta Tau
                  spread. Students on campus learned of Silicon Valley Engineers
                  through the professional, community service, and brotherhood
                  events that organization hosted. All of these events,
                  meetings, gatherings, connections, and relationships have been
                  brought about as a result of establishing the Silicon Valley
                  Engineers and shown to be the foundation of an influential
                  group of students. These are students who challenge and
                  nurture each other while striving to inspire both life and
                  passion in those who seek it in the field of engineering.

                <p>
                  Theta Tau is the oldest, largest, and foremost Fraternity for
                  Engineers. Since its founding at the University of Minnesota
                  in 1904, over 40,000 have been initiated over the years. With
                  emphasis on quality and a strong fraternal bond, the
                  Fraternity has chapters only at ABET accredited schools and
                  limits the number of student members in any one of its
                  chapters across the nation.
                </p>
